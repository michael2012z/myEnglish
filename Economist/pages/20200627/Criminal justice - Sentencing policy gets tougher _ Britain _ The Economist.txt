Jun 27th 2020FacebookTwitterLinkedInWhatsAppPOLITICIANS’ REACTIONS to the toppling and daubing of statues of historical figures have been telling. Priti Patel, the home secretary, issued a headline-grabbing promise of retribution; Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition, responded with dull but reasonable nuance; Boris Johnson promised to cherish the memory of Winston Churchill; and Tory backbenchers started talking about the war.Some of those MPs want to make it a specific offence to desecrate a war memorial. Such an act would already count as criminal damage but, if it cost less than £5,000 to repair, the culprits could only be fined or put behind bars for three months. Not nearly enough, say the backbenchers, who want sentences of up to ten years. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, agrees that vandals of this sort should face stiffer penalties in future. Such memorials, he wrote, have a symbolic value that cannot “be measured in pounds, shillings and pence”, as though that anachronism proved his reverence for the past.In recent years, the Tory party has flirted with penal reform. Michael Gove brought an unusual radicalism to the Ministry of Justice. David Gauke, Mr Buckland’s predecessor, wanted to ditch prison sentences of six months or less, arguing that they provide insufficient time for rehabilitation. But a stern view of law and order, encapsulated by the insistence of Michael Howard, a former leader, that “prison works”, is central to Mr Johnson’s populism—hence the shift on sentencing policy.Sentence inflation is already one of the main causes of the persistently high prison population in England and Wales. For every 100,000 residents, 134 are locked up—fewer than in America but more than in Germany or France. The average custodial sentence increased by four months between 1993 and 2018, but sentences for the most serious crimes got far longer. The average sentence for sex offenders increased from 49 to 58 months between 2009 and 2019 and for those convicted of criminal damage and arson from just over a year and a half behind bars to more like three.Though the judiciary determines sentences, politicians have plenty of scope to influence them. The most direct route is to pass new laws with stiffer penalties, such as the desecration of war memorials bill. Parliament passed legislation in 2018 laying out specific penalties for assaults on emergency workers. Ms Patel has already promised to revise it to double the maximum prison sentence to two years. Such laws tend only to increase sentences. “It would be a very brave politician who stands up and says we’re sentencing people for far too long,” says an ex-justice secretary. “You just can’t do it.”The government also has indirect power. Ms Patel cannot personally direct a police operation, but she can make it clear—through front-page headlines—that she wants the protesters who damaged statues tried. By giving interviews and making speeches, ministers can nudge the criminal-justice system in a more punitive or liberal direction. “You set the mood music,” says the ex-minister. Magistrates, who deal with most criminal offences and can hand down sentences of up to a year in jail, are especially likely to be influenced by the tone taken by ministers and the media. “They are lay people,” says Harvey Redgrave of Crest Advisory, a criminal-justice consultancy. “They read the newspapers.”Since the covid-19 outbreak began, the prison population has shrunk by 5% to just under 80,000 after ministers ordered some prisoners to be released early to reduce the spread of the virus in jails. But that fall is likely to be short-lived. Spiralling sentences will mean longer stays for new arrivals. And the government’s commitment to hire 20,000 more police officers will inevitably lead to more arrests, convictions and prison sentences. Meanwhile, more than a third of inmates are caught reoffending within a year of their release. Prison doesn’t work very well, but that won’t stop ministers giving it another go.
