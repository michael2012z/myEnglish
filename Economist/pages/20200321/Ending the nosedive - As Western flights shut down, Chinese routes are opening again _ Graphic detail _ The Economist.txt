Mar 21st 2020FacebookTwitterLinkedInWhatsAppOF ALL THE industries ravaged by covid-19, aviation is one of the most afflicted. Governments have closed borders and discouraged travel. In response, most Western airlines plan to cut capacity on international flights by about 80%. The descent has been so steep that CAPA, a consultancy, says that most airlines will go bankrupt by the end of May without state aid. Yet in the very country where covid-19 began, this trend has started to reverse.In late January China imposed a quarantine to contain the virus. Within weeks, capacity on both internal and international routes fell by about 75%, making up nearly all of the world’s cancelled flights in February. The decline in passengers was greater still. Even after a big cut in capacity, 71% of seats on flights to and from Guangzhou’s biggest airport in February were empty.Since then, China seems to have put the worst behind it. The number of new covid-19 cases it reports per day has dwindled to a few dozen. Some observers doubt these figures’ veracity. But the government is confident enough to have closed its last covid-19 hospital—and to promote flying. On March 4th it began offering subsidies to carriers that resume international flights.On domestic routes, the recovery has already begun. Capacity has risen from 4.2m seats per week in late February to 8.6m now. In a filing on March 16th to OAG, a data provider, Chinese airlines increased the number they expect to offer by April from 10m to 12.6m. That would nearly match last year’s level in time for two big holidays, the Qingming festival and Labour Day.There is no guarantee that people will fill these flights. The government owns stakes in three of the four big Chinese carriers, and could tell them to fly mostly empty planes at a loss, to restore connectivity between cities and facilitate an economic recovery. Nonetheless, Chris Tarry, a consultant, suggests that the schedule changes are motivated at least in part by a genuine rise in expected demand.Airlines that serve China are displaying more caution on international routes. As Western countries tighten travel rules, OAG data show that carriers are heavily revising down their seat capacity on flights entering China in April. For months, the world worried about the risk posed by Chinese visitors. Now, it may be China’s turn to worry about travellers from abroad.
