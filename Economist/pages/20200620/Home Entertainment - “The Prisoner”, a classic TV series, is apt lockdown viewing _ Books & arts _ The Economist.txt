Jun 20th 2020FacebookTwitterLinkedInWhatsAppA  MAN ANGRILY quits his job in London and drives his sports car home. He awakes the next morning, draws the curtains—and finds himself in a fantastical Italianate village. Confused, then indignant, he tries to leave. But the taxis and telephones provide “local service only”. The village and its inhabitants are nameless. Number 2 is in charge, though he answers to an unseen superior. The man is told: “You are Number 6.”A British television drama first screened in 1967, “The Prisoner” is either perfect lockdown viewing or the opposite, depending on your disposition. Over 17 episodes, Number 6 rages against his confinement and the village’s stifling, sinister bureaucracy. “We have a saying here,” says a villager. “A still tongue makes a happy life.” The hero demurs. He gets out by helicopter, and later in a boat fashioned from his winning entry to the village art show, in which all the exhibits exalt Number 2. But he is foiled. His handlers were in control all along.You never learn exactly what his job was, but it was plainly secret, official and important. Why did he resign? The task of successive Number 2s is to trick, cajole, bully or torture him into telling. One tries to manipulate his dreams. Another confronts him with his double. Still others dangle damsels in distress. None of your damn business, he tells them.It is easy to over-analyse “The Prisoner”, and many fans have. A banner at a recent anti-lockdown march in London proclaimed (but garbled) Number 6’s cry of defiance: “I am not a number: I am a free man!” According to Andrew Pixley’s guide to the series, over-interpretation of the story irked its two creators, Patrick McGoohan, the star and executive producer, and George Markstein, the script editor.Nevertheless, they plainly wanted to make their viewers think. “The Prisoner” invites you to ponder the relationship between the individual and authority—though you needn’t conclude that a coronavirus lockdown amounts to a conspiracy against the people. The potential abuse of technology and surveillance is a recurring theme. The inhabitants of the village can be observed night and day; in one episode they absorb a history course, beamed from their televisions directly into their brains, within seconds.At bottom, “The Prisoner” remains a bizarre yet brilliant TV classic, about a spy whose masters won’t let him go. Though expensively made for its time—it was shot in colour and on location—it still has plenty of flaws. The plot can be downright confusing, not least in the final unmasking of Number 1. But it has an abundance of charms, including its picturesque setting in Portmeirion, north Wales. Above all it has McGoohan’s steel-gazed, black-blazered hero, railing indomitably against his captors. Does he finally escape? Watch it, and see for yourself.
