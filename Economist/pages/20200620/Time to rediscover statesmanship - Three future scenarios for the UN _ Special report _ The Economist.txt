Jun 20th 2020FacebookTwitterLinkedInWhatsAppIN A SPEECH in January Mr Guterres conjured up “four horsemen” to describe the challenges facing the world. The first represented the worst geostrategic tensions in years, with a real risk of a “great fracture”. Next, said the secretary-general, the planet was burning, and an existential crisis was close to a point of no return. His third horseman took the form of rising global mistrust, often spilling into hatred, amid discontent over inequality and the sense among too many that globalisation is not working. Lastly, the dark side of digital technology threatened to invade privacy, disrupt work and unleash lethal autonomous machines in war.If this was not apocalyptic enough, a fifth horseman is now galloping around the globe. Covid-19 has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and plunged the world into a recession far deeper than that of 2008-09. Worse could be to come if the virus proceeds to devastate poorer countries before boomeranging back into rich ones. And in response the world has seemed rudderless. National leaders have been too preoccupied fighting the disease in their own countries to have much appetite for international efforts. And at the UN, the Security Council has been a bystander.The nightmare scenario is a descent into deepening disorder. Imagine that after the covid-19 crisis is over, Mr Guterres’s horsemen run rampant. Any hope that the world can summon the will to tackle climate change vanishes. Under pressure, institutions that have sustained a rules-based system buckle. Unrestrained protectionism kills the WTO. America abandons NATO, as its European partners slash defence spending to prioritise economic recovery. Divisions between northern and southern members prove too much for the EU. The UN goes the way of the League of Nations, failing to stop rival powers from provoking each other and, in the end, fighting.While such bedlam is possible, a likelier scenario is less dramatic: bumbling along. Inertia helps the main multilateral institutions survive, despite their inability to modernise themselves, and second-tier powers keep co-operation alive. Future American presidents restore a degree of confidence in the country’s commitment to the international order, although the trauma of transactional Trumpism casts a long shadow. America’s return to the Paris agreement lends weight to efforts to tackle climate change.The tussle between America and China continues. But America makes a more concerted counter-push, working with its European and Asian allies, with a revived championing of universal values. In many parts of the world mistrust of China runs deep. Russia still makes mischief, but less often, since a more coherent West gives it fewer opportunities. The multipolar system becomes less “chaotic” and more contained, settling into an uneasy stalemate. Perhaps this is enough to keep the four horsemen in their stables.Just possibly, extraordinary times could provide the jolt the world needs to be bolderBumbling along in this way would not be the worst outcome. But it would be a waste of a crisis. Just possibly, extraordinary times could provide the jolt the world needs to be bolder, even if for now this seems improbable. Little or no global leadership can be expected from America under Mr Trump. The pandemic has pushed most other issues aside: planned gatherings on big global issues, such as climate change and nuclear non-proliferation, have been postponed. Yet the delay may be a blessing in disguise, giving fresh thinking a chance.Already, some see opportunities ahead. In Europe Mr Macron is alive to the idea that the time may become ripe for big ideas. Britain’s Boris Johnson always welcomes a chance to play Churchill. Ideas for making the post-covid-19 economy greener are sprouting, as are concerns to make it fairer. Perhaps China could be persuaded to take part in a new round of nuclear arms control, which could serve as a start to rebuild relations with Russia.Global organisations have a shot at change, too. Just as the second world war prompted leaders to create institutions to prevent wars, Bill Gates believes the covid-19 crisis will lead them to build institutions to prevent pandemics and, alongside national and regional bodies, to guard against bioterrorism. Co-operation on viruses could serve as a model for collaboration to strengthen resilience in cyberspace. The shock to the system could even be profound enough to prompt a serious go at reforming the UN Security Council before it grows even less representative of the realities of power in the 21st century. Ample groundwork has been done. What is missing is political will.Let’s go to San FranciscoNone of this can happen overnight. A start could come from a P5 summit, with a further push at the 75th-anniversary meeting of the Global Assembly in September. Because of the pandemic, this will be a more limited affair than originally envisaged, perhaps with a mix of physical and virtual presence, but it can still dignify the occasion and show a worldwide wish for closer collaboration. It should also be an opportunity to look ahead, mapping the way to reforms designed to ensure that the UN is still in business at 100.If the wartime model were followed, the road might even lead to a grand convention, as in San Francisco in 1945. The main actors at that conference were the delegates of the governments involved, especially the big powers. But in all—counting the secretariat workers, the press, interpreters, security personnel and assorted lobbyists and observers—about 5,000 people crowded into town, in a foretaste of the General Assembly that clogs New York every September. “Consultants” representing industries, labour, religions, professions, women and minorities were accredited. They managed to influence the charter on education and human rights, and successfully pushed for an article allowing the UN’s Economic and Social Council to consult NGOs. A rethink of the rules ought to be even more inclusive.Such a prospect looks far-fetched when the world is consumed by the fight against a virus, and when America and two other big powers are waging a new cold war. But in the midst of the second world war it was hard to imagine that institutions would emerge that would keep the peace for three-quarters of a century. The statesmanship that created them is now needed once again.
